# LCS
LCS is an algorithm to find the Longest Common Subsequence between two Strings.
for example, we can use this simple algorithm to find the most similar DNA to that of human or compare DNAs to find a match.(yeah i know thats cool :D)

# How To Use:
it's very simple. just find an IDE that runs C++, copy and past the code inside the LCS.cpp to your IDE blanck project and Run the code!

# Fetures:
you can see what is happening to your data and how we get to the output!

# Have fun!
